Create virtual environment inside of this directory or some else directory which is not inside of project. 
But if you want to create virtual environment inside of project you should name it venv(I already add venv
to .gitignore no matter the directory of it. To create virtual environment the command should be :
virtualenv venv
then to activate:
for windows:
source env/bin/activate
for mac:
. venv/bin/activate

Then you should install packages in requirements if any new package was added to project :
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then the project is ready to go. To create or update database:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8020
(8020 is the serve port for annotation backend is served in 8000 in same AWS machine)
if that does not work try with python3 like:
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8020 (sometimes virtualenv needs to specified version of python)
