After you started the docker and be sure about docker is running you can simply 
run this commands :
docker-compose build
then
docker-compose up
in the first time you start the project. 
After that only docker-compose up will be sufficient unless any database or
library change occurs. If this will be the case you should also run docker-compose build 
before docker-compose up. Sometimes build does not install libraries that you need
if this is the case you need to run docker-compose down first then build then up.
