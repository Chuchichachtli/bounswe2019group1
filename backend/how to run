After pulling last version of project go to the directory backend/tradersplatform.
Then create virtual environment inside of this directory or some else directory which is not inside of project. 
But if you want to create virtual environment inside of project you should locate the virtual 
enviroment exactly in the /bounswe2019group1/backend/tradersplatform/  because .gitignore has
been written according to that. To create virtual environment the command should be :
virtualenv "name_of_virtualenv"
then to activate:
for windows:
source env/bin/activate
for mac:
. venv/bin/activate
You should create virtual environment for only first time but activate every time. 
Then you should install packages in requirements if any new package was added to project :
pip install -r requirements.txt
Then the project is ready to go. To create or update database:
python manage.py makemigrations --settings=mobilfuar.settings.sqlite
python manage.py migrate --settings=mobilfuar.settings.sqlite
After that you can run the project:
python manage.py runserver --settings=mobilfuar.settings.sqlite
*settings in manage.py actually for docker run so setting should be given by hand when running locally
